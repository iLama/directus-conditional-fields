# Directus conditional fields

Conditional fields is a custom extension that allow you to hide and show fields in a collection

![Directus conditional fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucasfrey/directus-conditional-fields/master/directus-conditional-fields.gif "Directus conditional fields")

# Usage
### Type dropdown
Add a `type` dropdown to your collection. It will host the event listener and will trigger the hide and show fields
e.g:
Type:
	- editorial
	- image
	- quote
	- ...

### Field naming convention
Once you have setup your `type` field, you need to name your fields like the above
(example with a collection named `blocks` you will need to start your field name with the singular `block`)

| collection | type      | field   |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| block      | editorial | text    |
| block      | editorial | intro   |
| block      | image     | picture |
| block      | image     | alt     |

> Also you can include `global` fields, that will be visible for any type

| collection | type      | field   |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| block      | global	 | title   |
| block      | global	 | slug	   |

So the fields in the database should be like
```
block_editorial_text
block_editorial_intro
block_image_picture
block_image_alt
block_global_title
block_global_slug
```

With that config, if you select the type `editorial` in the dropdown, only the `title`, `slug`, `text` and `intro` fields will appear on the screen.

### Import conditional-fields into the collection
Once you have setup your fields, you can then just add the `conditional-fields` field so the javascript can do his job on the administration page.

*NOTE*: you will have to name the field `conditional_interface`

And that's it !
